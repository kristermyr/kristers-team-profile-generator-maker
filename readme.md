# Kristers Team Profile Generator Maker
  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache-yellow.svg)    

  
  ## Description
The team profile generator shows some of my newly learned skills working with node.js, classes and tests. I have learned an introduction in how you can connect classes to different properties and push that information to a HTML file. I did not have enough time to finish it as much as I would like. I would have changed up the looks of it to make it a little more stylish.
